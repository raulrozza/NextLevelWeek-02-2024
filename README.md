# Next Level Week 02/2024

It's been a long time since I've joined a Next Level Week, from Rocketseat. This is a simple voting project, where the user can create polls and vote on them. Users can also subscribe to receive realtime feedback when the voting results change.

## Tools

The most interesting tools used here are:
- Prisma,  the ORM
- Redis
- Websockets
- Fastify, the API framework

## Conclusion
This project is overall pretty simple, and works more like a fastify tutorial project since I had never used it before.
Besides adding Eslint (which I cannot work without) and some minor code changes, the code is the same as the one in the class.
